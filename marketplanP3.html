                <h1 style="color: white;">4.3 Sales Strategy</h1>
                <p style="color: white">The companyâ€™s sale strategy will focus on two factors. First is through the emphasis of
                    choice. Some customers may find it hard to choose among a fixed and coordinated set
                    of items and so, a customizable package was created to allow them to organize their
                    own. However, there might be others who find themselves indecisive on what to choose
                    to place in their packages; thus, the specified sets are made readily available for buyers
                    to purchase. Personalized add-ons are also an option applicable for both types of
                    packages, allowing the customer to add their own extra-special touch to their self-care
                    kit. Second, we also aim to provide customers with a smooth transaction process.
                    Buying online from our store may seem an overwhelming experience considering the
                    amount of items and variety of choices thus, we want to make sure that we deliver the
                    best of our service and abilities starting from their browsing up until their delivery
                    experience.</p><br>
                    
                    <h1 style="color: white;">4.4 Product Characteristics or Features</h1>
                <p style="color: white">Comfort Crate will use the following competitive features found in our products to obtain
                    a successful reach within our market:</p><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><u>Variety of Options:</u> As mentioned in the previous section, customers can choose
                            from three pre-made sets or they can also choose to customize the contents on
                            their own. They also have the ability to choose from three personalized add-ons
                            to go along with their packages. Another added bonus is the option to choose
                            among some of the items in the snack set, namely for the candies and small
                            chips part so that customers can fully enjoy them at their fullest.</li>
                            <li><u>Affordability:</u> In reference to the competitor brands mentioned in the market
                                analysis section, our prices are comparably lower or on par compared to others.
                                For example, Sweet Soulâ€™s relaxation set costs PHP 330 with about five items
                                (eye mask, scrunchie, lemona packets, motivational cards) in their package while
                                our relaxation set costs PHP 249 with six items (sheet mask, eye mask, katinko
                                rub, mini-electric massager, squishy toy, and sleep mask) included in the kit.</li>
