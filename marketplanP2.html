                <p style="color: white">Comfort Crate will employ various marketing strategies that will communicate our
                    productâ€™s main purpose and showcase our special selling points.</p><br>
                    <h3 style="color: white;">Social Media Marketing</h3>
                    <p style="color: white" class="smalltext">Social media has cemented itself as a significant part of our daily lives
                        (even more so with the ongoing pandemic) thus, making it the perfect
                        avenue for our brand to connect to a wider audience. As people become
                        more increasingly aware of the importance of mental health with the help
                        of the internet, we can utilize social media, mainly Facebook, Twitter,
                        Instagram, and TikTok to promote our products and how we can help
                        contribute to this rising cause.</p><br>

                        <h3 style="color: white;">Content Marketing</h3>
                    <p style="color: white" class="smalltext">In line with our social media marketing, our company plans to promote our
                        products by putting out various content online using a number of creative
                        methods. This includes video advertisements (will be applied heavily on
                        Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram), eye-catching graphic posters and
                        images (will be applied mostly on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram),
                        hashtag and profile frame events people can participate in (will be applied
                        mostly on Twitter and Facebook), interactive story posts (will be applied
                        on Facebook and Instagram), and many more.</p><br>

                    <h3 style="color: white;">Relationship Marketing</h3>
                        <p style="color: white" class="smalltext">Part of our product line includes a customized set as well as the option of
                            having personalized add-ons. This adds to the possibility of having direct
                            contact with our buyers in case they ask for assistance or are in need of
                            further clarifications. As such, our team aims to provide our customers
                            with exemplary customer service, allowing us to build and maintain strong
                            relationships with our buyers.</p><br>
                            
                            <h3 style="color: white;">Communal Marketing</h3>
                            <p style="color: white" class="smalltext">Our company also aims to use the testimonies and feedback we receive
                                from our customers as part of our marketing strategy. Sharing their
                                experiences in how Comfort Crate was able to help in their act of self-care
                                for themselves or their loved ones can help us build a stronger following
                                and attract potential customers along the way.</p><br>
