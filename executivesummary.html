                <p style="color: white">Comfort Crate is a start-up company founded in 2022 by seven students from 12-Dubins
                    of Pasig City Science High School. The notion of entrepreneurs and consumers as mutual benefactors inspired the team to come up with potential products that will make self-care worth
                    spending, guilt-free.<br><br>
                    Driven by the desire to uplift peopleâ€™s spirits amidst adversities, each set from Comfort
Crate was curated for all people in all situations. The group believes that money cannot buy
happiness, but it can buy you a crate that can help you stir up your own happiness.<br><br>
Stress is extremely common among people around the world. According to
SingleCare.com, one third of the population is said to experience moderate to extreme stress. In
addition, more than three-quarters of adults report symptoms of stress, including headache,
tiredness, or sleeping problems (American Psychological Association, 2019). It is not a disease
but it contributes to the cause of mental health problems and may physically affect an individual.
Knowing this, our company thought of a way to help people suffering from stress together with
relieving the pressure of decision making in picking products to help them cope.<br><br>
Comfort Crate offers a variety of sets of customized goods specifically made to align with
the people's taste and interest in alleviating stress and spoiling themselves. Each product inside
our comfort crate box created by our team is fastidiously picked and has been based on the
majority's taste in the variety of product choices. Our products are made to aid every individualâ€™s
self care needs by compiling all the things they love in a box. Our business offers three different
packages, the Letter Set, Relax Set, and Snack Set. Each box of sets offers a quality content
with its very own theme in relieving our customerâ€™s stress.
